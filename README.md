# OpenJDK Developers' Guide

This Project maintains the [OpenJDK Developers' Guide](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/). The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might have around development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and processes are described in other documents, such as [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal & Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents, with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK Community.

There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This guide suggests how to work in such cases.

## Audience

The target audience for this document is anyone in the OpenJDK Community who aims to contribute to the development of the JDK but is not yet familiar with the process. People who are already regular contributors will already know much of what this guide has to offer. Still, the Developers' Guide should work as a source of knowledge also for experienced contributors. Any descriptions in the Guide should thus be self-contained or have explicit references to any information that the reader is expected to already know. The information should also be structured in such a way that it's easy to find the details for any process, so that a reader who already knows the big picture can quickly find a particular detail that was forgotten.

## Contributing

To engage in the development of the Developers' Guide itself, create a private fork and join the dedicated [guide-dev mail list](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/guide-dev).

## Building the Developers' Guide

The project comes with a `Makefile`. Simply type `make` to generate HTML files from the source Markdown. The build requires the tools `pandoc`, `iconv`, and `perl` and assumes a POSIX environment. We recommend using at least pandoc 2.0.

To generate the diagrams, you also need the `mermaid-filter` for pandoc. You can install this by running `npm install --global mermaid-filter --unsafe-perm=true`.

The resulting HTML files in the `build` directory are exactly the files published on the [OpenJDK web server](https://openjdk.java.net/guide/). There is, however, a larger framework on the web server with fonts and CSS that is not part of this project. This means that the HTML files as they are generated will not look exactly the same as the final published version. Still they are hopefully good enough to proof read changes and see the layout in a browser.

## Todo

The Developers' Guide is continuously updated and there are several parts still missing. This todo list isn't complete and there is no limitation on current work being tied to any item on this list. It's just a list of things that we know are missing or needs to be updated. The list isn't ordered in any way.

* All SCM references should be updated to GIT
* JEPs - When do I need one? - Working with JEPs
* Reference external CSR pages with small intro that is unlikely to need updates
* Document release note process
* Add "stakeholders" for each section
* Add references to current code conventions for Java, C++, Markdown, Makefiles
* Text about adding an API
* Text about adding a feature
* Text about testing
* Text about JCK
* Text about JBS, triage, priorities, status
* List JTReg `@key` conventions for different areas
* Document best practices around TEST.properties usage. See [PR#30](https://github.com/openjdk/guide/pull/30#issuecomment-714589551)
* How to work with the code in an IDE
* Where to find JTReg bundles
* How to run tests with your fork and how to navigate the test result ZIP
* Text about how to create a PR - What to do and what not to do
* Logging in hotspot - available strategies, what is preferred and where, how to log in special conditions

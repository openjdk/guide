<h1>Producing a Changeset</h1>

<div class="version">version 0.02</div>
<div class="NavBit">
  <a href="jckAcquisition.html">&laquo;&nbsp;Previous</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="index.html">TOC</a>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;<a href="next.html">Next&nbsp;&raquo;</a>
</div>

<p> This section is confined to the actual Mercurial mechanics required to
produce a changeset: </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#jdkUserName">Setting a JDK User Name</a> reminds the user to
    confirm proper configuration. </li>
<li><a href="#create">Creating</a> includes instructions for the required
    format of a changeset comment and describes how to commit files to a
    changeset. </li>
<li><a href="#merge">Merging</a> describes how to pull changes from a parent
    forest or clone and incorporate the changes into the current working set of
    files. </li>
<li><a href="#push">Pushing</a> covers configuring ssh, setting
    the <code>default-push</code> path, and pushing changesets. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="jdkUserName">Setting a JDK User Name</a></h2>

<p> Ensure that <em>ui.username</em> has a value in the <code>~/.hgrc</code>
file as described in <a href="repositories.html#verify">Verifying the
Configuration</a>. </p>

<h2><a name="create">Creating</a></h2>

<p> The timing for creating a changeset is important. Creating the changeset
long before it gets pushed into the parent repository may require complex
merges.  If a changeset is created before sufficient review or testing, a
rollback may be required and a new changeset may be required to correct
previous mistakes. The <a
href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch12.html#x16-26500012">mq extension</a>
is recommended for managing changes before they become committed to a
changeset. </p>

<p> In the examples below, the script <code>common/bin/hgforest.sh</code>
can be used to apply the Mercurial command to all the repositories in the
forest. So when you see <code><i><b>hg</b></i></code>, if you are dealing with
one repository, just use "<code>hg</code>", if it's a forest, use "<code>sh
common/bin/hgforest.sh</code>". </p>
    
<p> Each repository in the forest is managed independently.  After editing
files in the individual cloned repositories of the forest, the <code>hg
status</code> command may be used to see the changes in a single
repository. </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ hg root
/u/iris/sandbox/box
$ hg status
? duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
$ hg add duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
$ hg status
A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
</pre></blockquote>

<p> To see changes made to the repositories use
<code><i><b>hg</b></i> status</code>: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ <code><i><b>hg</b></i></code> status
[.]
A duke/images/DukeTubbingSmall.png
</pre></blockquote>

<p> In this example, the repository was previously cloned as described in <a
href="repositories.html#cloneSandbox">Cloning a Sandbox Repository</a>.  A new
file <code>DukeTubbingSmall.png</code> was added to a new subdirectory. </p>

<h3><a name="changesetComment">Formatting a Changeset Comment</a></h3>

<p> A single change is described by a block of text of the following form: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
&lt;bugid&gt;: &lt;synopsis-of-symptom&gt;
Summary: &lt;summary-of-code-change&gt;
Reviewed-by: &lt;reviewer&gt;+
Contributed-by: &lt;contributor-email&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p> There may be more than one <em>bugid</em> line, but there must be at least
one. </p>

<p> The <em>summary</em> line is optional, but authors are strongly encouraged
to include one if the nature of the change is not obvious from the synopsis.
It's just one line, meant to give the reader a clue as to how the code changed.
A more complete description of the change belongs in the bug report. </p>

<p> A <em>reviewed-by</em> line is required.  Reviewers must have the ability
to deal with any adverse consequences of the change, and so must themselves be
authors.  They are therefore identified by their OpenJDK usernames rather than
full e-mail addresses. </p>

<p> The <em>contributed-by</em> line is optional.  If present, it is a
list of comma-separated email addresses.  It should be included only
when the author or authors of the change do not have commit rights to
the target repository and thus would not otherwise receive
acknowledgment. </p>

<p> There will be exceptions for merge changesets, tag changesets, etc. </p>

<p> Example: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
1234567: NPE thrown on FileInputStream("")
Summary: Rewrite precondition-checking code in io.c
Reviewed-by: mr
Contributed-by: Ben Bitdiddle &lt;ben at bits.org&gt;
</pre></blockquote>

<p> If a changeset contains multiple unrelated changes (this is frowned upon,
but may happen from time to time) then its comment will contain multiple blocks
of the above form, separated by blank lines. </p>

<p> The required format of the comments will be enforced whenever the changeset
is pushed into the JDK master or team repository forests.  Other
Projects may copy these conventions, adopt some other conventions, or have no
conventions, depending upon their goals. </p>

<h3><a name="committing">Committing a Changeset</a></h3>

<p> The following commands commit all of the changes in a repository to a
changeset. </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ cat ../message

<h2><a name="merge">Merging</a></h2>

<p> It is often necessary to merge local changes with those made in the parent
repositories.  The first step in a merge process is to retrieve (or pull) the
collection of changesets which have been pushed since the last merge or initial
clone.  If there if there are merge conflicts, then they must be resolved.
<a href="http://hgbook.red-bean.com/hgbookch3.html#x7-530003">Chapter 3</a> of
the Mercurial book contains detailed information on the merging process. </p>

<p> There are two basic ways to update the working set files in the
repositories: </p>

<dl>
<dt>Option 1: <code><i><b>hg</b></i> pull</code></dt>
<dd>One way to merge the parent repository with the working set of files is to
use <code><i><b>hg</b></i> pull</code> all by itself.
This option allows merging off-line or at a later time. 

<blockquote><pre>
$ <code><i><b>hg</b></i></code> pull
[.]
pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
searching for changes
no changes found
</pre></blockquote>

<p> In Mercurial, pulling changesets will not update or merge into the working
set of files.  To update the clone,
run <code><i><b>hg</b></i> update</code>.  If the update
reports conflicts,
run <code><i><b>hg</b></i> merge</code> to resolve them. </p>
</dd>

<dt>Option 2: <code><i><b>hg</b></i> fetch</code></dt>
<dd>Alternatively,
use <code><i><b>hg</b></i> fetch</code> to pull the changes, update
the working set files, and create simple merge changesets as necessary.
The fetch extension is distributed with Mercurial but needs to be enabled.
Edit the <code>.hgrc</code> to include the following entries:

<blockquote><pre>
[extensions]
fetch=
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Once the fetch extension has been enabled,
    <code><i><b>hg</b></i> fetch</code> may be
invoked as follows: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ <code><i><b>hg</b></i></code> fetch
[.]
pulling from http://hg.openjdk.java.net/sandbox/box
searching for changes
no changes found
</pre></blockquote></dd>

</dl>

<blockquote><hr />

<p> Actual file merging will be done with the selected Mercurial merging tool
see <a href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/MergeProgram">
MergeProgram</a> for the details on how to define the selected merge tool in
<code> ~/.hgrc</code>. </p>

<hr /></blockquote>

<h2><a name="push">Pushing</a></h2>

<p> In order to push changesets into the parent repository, some additional
configuration is required.  The following sections describe the operations that
will be performed by users with push access. </p>

<h3><a name="sshGen">Generating an SSH Key</a></h3>

<p> All pushes require an ssh key which must be installed on the Mercurial
server. The <code>ssh-keygen</code> command generates an ssh key.
The <code>-b</code> option overrides the default number of bits for the key.
Allow a few minutes to generate a 4096 bit key; a key of at least 2048 bits is
recommended.  While it is possible to use ssh without a passphrase, this
is <strong>strongly</strong> discouraged.  Empty or insecure passphrases may
be reset using <code>ssh-keygen -p</code>; this does not change the keys. </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
Enter file in which to save the key(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa):
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
md5 4096 c2:b7:00:e6:4b:da:ea:ec:32:30:f5:bd:12:26:04:83 iris@duke
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 4096]----+
|    E.=          |
|     . *         |
|      o .   .    |
|         + o     |
|        S + .    |
|       .   + .   |
|        + + +..  |
|       * . oo+.  |
|      o . .o..   |
+-----------------+
</pre></blockquote>

<p> The <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> is a text file containing the public
ssh key.  This file should be mailed as an attachment along with the JDK
username to 
<a href="mailto:keys(at)openjdk.java.net">keys(at)openjdk.java.net</a>.  An
administrator will install your key on the server and notify you on
completion.  This process may take a couple of days. </p>

<blockquote><hr />

<p> Users behind a SOCKS firewall can add a directive to the
<code>~/.ssh/config</code> file to connect to the OpenJDK Mercurial server: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
Host *.openjdk.java.net
ProxyCommand /usr/lib/ssh/ssh-socks5-proxy-connect -h [socks_proxy_address] %h %p
</pre></blockquote>

<p> See the <code>ssh-socks5-proxy-connect</code> man page and
<code>ssh-config</code> man page for more information.  Other systems may
require proxy access via other programs.  Some Linux distributions provide the
<code>corkscrew</code> package which provides ssh access through HTTP
proxies. </p>

<p> <strong>It is recommended that all users check with their network
administrators before installing any kind of TCP forwarding tool on their
network.  Many corporations and institutions have strict security policies in
this area.</strong> </p>

<hr /></blockquote>

<h3><a name="sshUse">SSH Shortcuts</a></h3>

<p> The following section provides some tips for improving the usability of
ssh-related operations. </p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Using SSH in multiple shells</em>

<p> To avoid having to constantly type in the passphrase, use the ssh-agent on
your local client to cache your pashphrase:
</p> 

<blockquote><pre>
$ eval `ssh-agent`
Agent pid 17450
$ ssh-add
Enter passphrase for /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa:
Identity added: /u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa(/u/iris/.ssh/id_rsa)
</pre></blockquote>

<p> The same ssh-agent process can be shared with multiple shells. There are
various ways to do this.  Bash users can accomplish this with the following
code in <code>.bashrc</code>: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
if [ "$PS1" -a -d $HOME/.ssh ]; then
  if [ "x$SSH_AUTH_SOCK" = x ]; then
    eval `ssh-agent | grep -v 'echo Agent pid'`
    ssh-add
    trap "echo Killing SSH agent $SSH_AGENT_PID; kill $SSH_AGENT_PID" 0
  fi
fi
</pre></blockquote>

<p> For secure operation, only start an ssh-agent when needed and kill it off
when the shell completes.  Test this by running <code>ssh `hostname` echo
hello</code> multiple times. </p></li>

<li> <em>Logging in without a password</em>

<p> To avoid needing to constantly type in the password, add the public key to
the list of ssh authorized keys. </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
</pre></blockquote></li>

</ul>

<h3><a name="defaultPath">Setting the <code>default-push</code> Path to the
Server Repositories</a></h3>

<!-- 
<dl>
<dt>Option 1: Add default-push path to every <code>.hg/hgrc</code></dt>
<dd>
-->

<p> This is the typical development model: </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="devModel.gif"
alt="Diagram of server repos and user's clone"/>
</p>

<p> Changesets need to be <em>pushed</em> via ssh to the read/write repository
which resides on the OpenJDK Mercurial server.  The easiest way to do this is
to have each repository define the "default-push" path in every
repository's <code>.hg/hgrc</code> file.  The <code>.hg/hgrc</code> file in is
not a managed file-- it is private to the repository.  The following example
defines the "default" and "default-push" paths for clones of the jdk9/dev team
repository. </p>

<blockquote><pre>
[paths]
default = http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev
default-push = ssh://&lt;JDK_username&gt;@hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk9/dev
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Given a <code>JDK_username</code> this simple script will attempt to do
this for all the repositories: </p>

<blockquote><pre>
#!/bin/sh
username=$1
hgdirs="`find . -type d -name .hg`"
for i in ${hgdirs}; do
  d="`dirname ${i}`"
  defpush="`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default-push 2> /dev/null)`"
  if [ "${defpush}" = "" ] ; then
    defpath="`(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths default 2> /dev/null)`"
    if [ "${defpath}" != "" ] ; then
      defpush="`echo ${defpath} | sed -e 's@http://\([^/]*/[^/]*/[^/]*\)/\(.*\)@ssh://$username\@\1/\2@'`"
      cp ${i}/hgrc ${i}/hgrc.orig
      echo "default-push = ${defpush}" >> ${i}/hgrc
      echo "Added default-push: ${defpush}"
    fi
  fi
done
for i in ${hgdirs}; do
  d="`dirname ${i}`"
  echo "(cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)"
  (cd ${d} &amp;&amp; hg paths)
done
exit 0
</pre></blockquote>

<!--

<dt>Option 2: Use the <code>defpath</code> Extension</dt>
<dd>Another way to setup the default-push path is to use the Mercurial defpath
    extension, which is available in /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py. To enable
    this extension add the following to the <code>~/hgrc</code> file:

<blockquote><pre>
[extensions]
defpath = /java/jdk/lib/hgext/defpath.py  # Or the pathname of a local copy
</pre></blockquote>

    <p> The defpath extension actually adds two new Mercurial subcommands:
    defpath to operate upon a single repository and fdefpath for an entire
    forest. hg help defpath or hg help fdefpath will tell you more. For a
    freshly cloned open/closed forest the command you probably want is </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ hg fdefpath -dgv
</pre></blockquote>

    <p> Be sure to try this with the -n flag first to see if it will do what
    you actually expect. If your OpenJDK username differs from your local
    username then add -u name to the command line. </p>

    <p> The defpath extension defines the default-push path, which is the path
    that Mercurial uses by default in push operations.  </p></dd>

<h3><a name="pushChangeset">Pushing a Changeset</a></h3>

<p> <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer">Committers</a>
can use the <code><i><b>hg</b></i> push</code> command to propagate changesets
into the repositories. </p> 

<p> Most developers will only find a need to create changesets in one or two
repositories. However, it is important that before any changesets are pushed,
the corresponding forest pull and merge with the destination forest be
performed; otherwise there is a risk of breaking the build. </p>

<blockquote><pre>
$ <code><i><b>hg</b></i></code> push
</pre></blockquote>

<p> After the push has been accepted, an automatic e-mail notification will be
sent to the <a href="http://mail.openjdk.java.net">mailing list</a> associated
with the repository.  In most cases notifications are sent to the
Project's <em>-dev</em> mailing list.  Some Projects with high
traffic <em>-dev</em> mailing lists use a dedicated <em>-changes</em> list for
notifications. </p>

<blockquote><hr />

<p> Who has push access? </p>

<p> All of a Project's
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer">Committers</a> can push 
to all of the the Project's repositories. </p>

<p> Some Projects may chose to restrict the set of Committers with push to key
repositories.  For instance, JDK Release Projects restrict push access to
MASTER repositories to Committers who are either integrators or members of the
Release Engineering Team. </p>

<p> Refer to the 
<a href="../projects/index.html#project-committer">Nominating a Contributor
or Author to be a Committer</a> section of the 
<a href="../projects/index.html">Project</a> page for information about
becoming a Project Committer. </p>

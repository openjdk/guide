The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing
list. A subscriber to an OpenJDK mailing list is referred to as a Participant
in the [Bylaws](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws). As a general recommendation we suggest
to subscribe to [announce](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/announce),
[discuss](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo/discuss), and the `-dev` lists
covering your explicit area of interest. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:

> [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)

The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it's important to
keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
Even though English is the required language for all lists, many Participants
speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect
English is expected from anyone joining these lists.

You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
conversations on the list.

There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what
the list is intended for, `<name>-<suffix>`. The name often refers to the project
that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on.
The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of
lists described here.

> `-dev`
> :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This
       is also where code reviews happen.

> `-use`
> :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.

> `-discuss`
> :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`
       is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new
       project proposals usually happens here.

>  `-changes`
> :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.

> `-announce`
> :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are
       expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`
       is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.

> `-experts`
> :    Expert group discussions. The list is restricted; only members of the expert
       group can subscribe.

> `-observers`
> :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially
       to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is
       subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.

> `-comments`
> :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback/comments to the experts (typically
       a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).

The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.
All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the project mailing
list. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:

> [`mail.openjdk.java.net`](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)

The OpenJDK community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it's important to
keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global.
Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists.
Even though English is the required language for all lists, many participants
speak other languages as their mother tongue. A high tolerance for non-perfect
English is expected from anyone joining these lists.

You must be in the list to send to the list. Some lists are moderated to keep the
content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older
conversations on the list.

There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what
the list is intended for, `<project>-<suffix>`, where the first part is the project
that owns the list and the second part is explained below.

> `-dev`
> :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This
       is also where code reviews happen.

> `-use`
> :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.

> `-discuss`
> :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss(at)openjdk.java.net`
       is used for general discussions around the OpenJDK project. Discussions around new
       project proposals usually happens here.

>  `-changes`
> :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.

> `-announce`
> :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are
       expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce(at)openjdk.java.net`
       is used for announcements for the OpenJDK project.

> `-comments`
> :    Expert group comments around the project.

> `-experts`
> :    Expert group discussions (moderated).

> `-observers`
> :    List used to follow and comment on the discussions in the corresponding `-experts` list.

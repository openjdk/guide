The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work.

This section will contain a pointer to the existing
[mailing list page](http://mail.openjdk.java.net/mailman/listinfo)
and any associated infrastructure. It will describe the
naming conventions, for instance _&ast;-dev_ and
_&ast;-discuss_ and other suffixes such as those for code
review requests, changeset notifications, and automatic bug updates as these
services become available.

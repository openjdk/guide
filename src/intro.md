Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers' Guide!

OpenJDK is the place to collaborate on an open-source implementation
of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.
OpenJDK was created when the JDK was first released under the GPLv2 license in May
2007 and since then a community has grown around it to help develop and maintain Java.

In order to work together efficiently clear directions are sometimes needed to
avoid misconceptions and to align developers' views of terminology and process.
The OpenJDK community is a fairly pragmatic place. "Do what's right" is most
often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
everyone's work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For
this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
recommended ways to do things.

The goal of this guide is to answer questions that the developers of the JDK might
have around development process, tooling, standards, etc. The formal rules and
processes are described in other documents, like [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)
for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal & Roadmap Process, or [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)
for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement with tutorials
and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest
of the OpenJDK community.

There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This
guide contains the defacto standard for how to work in such cases.

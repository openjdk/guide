Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers' Guide!

The OpenJDK Community is the place to collaborate on open-source implementations
of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.  It was created in
November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under
the GPLv2 license.

In order to work together efficiently, clear directions are sometimes needed to
avoid misconceptions and to align developers' views of terminology and process.
The OpenJDK Community is a fairly pragmatic place. "Do the right thing" is most
often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way
then everyone's work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For
this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the
recommended ways to do things.

The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might
have around development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and
processes are described in other documents, such as [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1)
for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal & Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3)
for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents,
with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest
of the OpenJDK Community.

There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This
guide suggests how to work in such cases.

When the JDK was released under the GPLv2 license in May 2007, the need for a
detailed document for contributors was anticipated. Translating rather
sophisticated institutional knowledge into a format suitable for non-Oracle
employees is always a challenge. This document attempts to address the needs of
developers who wish to participate in the future of the JDK.

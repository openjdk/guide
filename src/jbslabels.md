This table contains some frequently used JBS labels and their meaning. Please help keeping this dictionary up to date by adding your favorite labels. This table doesnâ€™t dictate how to use labels, but rather document how they are used. That said, obviously it will help everyone if we try to follow a common standard and use similar labels in the same way across all entities that use JBS.

> ### Labels are case sensitive
> When using labels in Jira gadgets (like pie charts, heat maps, and statistics tables) Jira will be case sensitive and treat e.g. OpenJDK and openjdk as two different labels. Searching however is case insensitive. This means that if you group a set of issues in a gadget based on a label, and then click one of the groups to see the list of issues, that list will contain more results than the gadget if there are usages of the label with different casing. This can be very confusing and for this reason the recommendation is to stick with the commonly used case for all labels, regardless of your personal taste for upper or lower case letters. Most labels are lower case only, but there are examples where upper case letters are used in the most common version of a label.

      There are many label variants that include the word triage in some form. The form described above is the only one recommended. Please refrain from using other forms.

      [**`intermittent-hardware`**]{#intermittent-hardware}
    </td>
    <td class="dictionary">
      An intermittent issue is one that fails sometimes but not always. The exact reason for the intermittent failure is per definition unknown. Once the reason has been identified the issue is no more considered intermittent. An issue isn't intermittent if some characteristics has been found that triggers the failure consistently, even if the actual cause for the failure has not been found. For instance if a test fails every time it is executed on a specific host but not on other hosts it wouldn't be considered intermittent as it fails consistently on that specific host. In other cases it may be that we know that a test sometimes is unlucky in some respect and fails due to this. This test could still be considered intermittent even though we know what the reason is if the reason itself appears intermittently.

      Some issues may seem intermittent when looking at test results, even though the reason for failing is actually known. One example is where a test fails consistently on a specific host, or due to specific conditions in the environment. These failures should not be considered intermittent but it may still be valuable to tag these in JBS with one of the labels **`intermittent-hardware`** or **`intermittent-environment`**. This will help to faster identify that the cause of the failure is known without having to read through the entire bug.

      A test that should be platform agnostic but is consistently failing on a specific OS would for instance be labeled with **`intermittent-environment`**, while a test that fails every time it is run on some specific hardware would be labeled with **`intermittent-hardware`**.

    </td>
    <td class="dictionary">
      The **`noreg-`**`.*` and **`nounit-`**`.*` labels are used to explain why a bugfix doesn't need/have a regression test or a unit test. The suffix of the label is described below.

[**`-sqe`**]{#noreg-sqe}
:    Change can be verified by running an existing SQE test suite; the bug should identify the suite and the specific test case(s).

[**`-jck`**]{#noreg-jck}
:    Change can be verified by running the JCK; the bug should identify the specific test case(s).

[**`-external`**]{#noreg-external}
:    Change can be verified by running an existing external test suite; the bug should identify the suite and the specific test case(s).

[**`-doc`**]{#noreg-doc}
:    Change only affects documentation.

[**`-demo`**]{#noreg-demo}
:    Change only affects demo code.

[**`-build`**]{#noreg-build}
:    Change only affects build infrastructure (makefiles, copyrights, scripts, etc.).

[**`-self`**]{#noreg-self}
:    Change is a fix to a regression or unit test itself.

[**`-perf`**]{#noreg-perf}
:    Change is for a performance bug for which writing a regression test is infeasible; the bug should describe how to verify the fix.

[**`-hard`**]{#noreg-hard}
:    It is too hard to write a regression or unit test for this bug (e.g., theoretical race condition, complex setup, reboot required, editing of installed files required, specific graphics card required); the bug should explain why.

[**`-long`**]{#noreg-long}
:    Testing requires a very long running time (e.g., more than a few minutes).

[**`-big`**]{#noreg-big}
:    Testing requires an unreasonable quantity of resources (e.g., tens of gigabytes of filesystem space).

[**`-trivial`**]{#noreg-trivial}
:    Change is so trivial that nothing could possibly go wrong with it.

[**`-cleanup`**]{#noreg-cleanup}
:    Change is a cleanup or refactoring of existing code that is covered by existing tests.

[**`-l10n`**]{#noreg-l10n}
:    Change only affects localized text.

[**`-undo`**]{#noreg-undo}
:    Change is a reversion of a previous faulty change.

[**`-other`**]{#noreg-other}
:    Regression or unit test is unnecessary or infeasible for some other reason; the bug report should explain why.

Examples:  If a bug fix only corrects a change in the build system, then add the **`noreg-build`** label to the corresponding bug. If the change improves loop optimizations in HotSpot, then add **`nounit-perf`** to the corresponding bug.

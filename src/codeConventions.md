This is a set of code conventions for for JDK Release Projects in the OpenJDK Community. Other OpenJDK Projects, and projects outside of OpenJDK, are welcome to adopt these guidelines as they see fit.

## Motivation
Code that looks familiar is easier to understand and therefore also easier to review, debug and maintain. To ensure that code looks familiar to all developers on the project it’s important to agree on a common set of conventions.

This document provides guidelines for low level coding practices such as how to indent code and how to name types and variables. Many of the stylistic choices are subjective and different developers may have different opinions about them. Keep in mind however, that having a consistent style is more important than to satisfy each individual developers preference.

## Guiding Principles
The guidelines in this document strive to maximize,

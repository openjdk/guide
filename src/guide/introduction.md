# Introduction

Welcome to the OpenJDK Developers' Guide!

The OpenJDK Community is the place to collaborate on open-source implementations of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects. It was created in November 2006, when initial portions of the JDK source code were published under the GPLv2 license.

In order to work together efficiently, clear directions are sometimes needed to avoid misconceptions and to align developers' views of terminology and process. The OpenJDK Community is a fairly pragmatic place. "Do the right thing" is most often the right course of action. Still, if people do things in the same right way then everyone's work becomes more transparent and easier for others to follow. For this reason most parts of the development process have standard flows that are the recommended ways to do things.

The goal of this guide is to answer questions that developers of the JDK might have around development process, tooling, standards, and so forth. The formal rules and processes are described in other documents, such as [JEP 1](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/1) for the JDK Enhancement-Proposal & Roadmap Process, and [JEP 3](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/3) for the JDK Release Process. This guide is meant to be a complement to such documents, with tutorials and examples for how to follow these rules and how to work together with the rest of the OpenJDK Community.

There are many common use cases that aren't detailed in the formal process. This guide suggests how to work in such cases.

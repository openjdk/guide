:::

[JBS](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/) is a public issue tracker used by many OpenJDK projects. It's open for anyone to read and search. In order to get write access you need to be registered in the [OpenJDK Census](https://openjdk.java.net/census), for instance by becoming an [Author](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#author) in an OpenJDK [Project](https://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#project).

## Filing a bug

When a new failure is found in the JDK a bug should be filed to describe and track the issue. Depending on your role in OpenJDK you can either use the [Bug Report Tool](https://bugreport.java.com/) or, if you are registered in the [OpenJDK Census](https://openjdk.java.net/census), report the bug directly in [JBS](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/). Try to make the bug report as complete as possible to make it easier to triage and investigate the bug.

A few things to keep in mind when filing a new bug:

* Before filing a bug, verify that there isn't already a bug filed for this issue.
  * Search [JBS](https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/) for things like the name of the failing test, assert messages, the name of the source code file where a crash occurred etc.
* If you suspect that the bug is a vulnerability, **don't file a JBS issue**. Instead send your bug report to [vuln-report@openjdk.java.net](mailto:vuln-report@openjdk.java.net).
  * Please do *not* report or discuss potential vulnerabilities on any open lists or other public channels.
  * See [OpenJDK Vulnerabilities](https://openjdk.java.net/groups/vulnerability/report) for more information.
* Make a reasonable attempt to narrow down which build or release the failure first appeared in.
* Add relevant [Labels]{.jbs-field} like [[intermittent]{.jbs-label}](#intermittent), [[regression]{.jbs-label}](#regression), [[noreg-self]{.jbs-label}](#noreg-self), [[tier1]{.jbs-label}](#tier) etc.
  * To find relevant labels see the [JBS Label Dictionary](#jbs-label-dictionary)
* Set [Affects Version/s]{.jbs-field} to the JDK version(s) where the failure was seen.
  * If the failure is found in an update train of the JDK (e.g. 11.0.x), please make an effort to see if the bug is also present in [mainline](https://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk/jdk/).
* Set priority
  * It's not the reporter's responsibility to set a correct priority, but a qualified guess is always better than a default value.
  * To help with setting the right priority consider things like how the bug impacts the product and our testing, how likely is it that the bug triggers, how difficult is it to work around the bug if it's not fixed soon, and whether it's a regression, since that may break existing applications. Regressions are often higher priority than long standing bugs and may block a release if not fixed.
* In the [Description]{.jbs-field}, always include (if possible):
  * full name of the failing tests
  * error messages
  * assert messages
  * stack trace
  * command line information
  * relevant information from the logs
* If the failure isn't reproducible with an existing OpenJDK test, attach a reproducer if possible.
* Only set [CPU]{.jbs-field} and/or [OS]{.jbs-field} fields if the bug **ONLY** happens on that particular platform.
* Always file separate bugs for different issues.
  * If two crashes looks related but not similar enough to for sure be the same, it's easier to close a bug as a duplicate than it is to extract the relevant info from a bug to create a new one later.

To find out which component to use for different bugs, consult the [directory to area mapping](#directory-to-area-mapping).

## Resolved - Incomplete

To resolve an issue as `Incomplete` is JBS lingo for "Need More Information". An issue that is `Resolved - Incomplete` is *not* closed but more information is needed to be able to work on it. If no more information is obtained within reasonable time the issue should be closed (`Closed - Incomplete`). Closing a resolved issue is done using the `Verify` option.

## JBS Labels

JBS labels are used to tag and group related issues. JBS labels are an open namespace, which means that anyone can create new labels at any time. In order to avoid confusion, however, it's best to reuse existing labels where possible. Most areas have their commonly used labels to identify issues in their respective area. Make an effort to find and use these labels. This can be done by editing the [Labels]{.jbs-field} field of a bug and entering the first few characters of the label you want to add. JIRA will pop up an autocomplete window with existing labels that match that prefix. Then choose one of the existing labels. Using the autocomplete window is preferable to typing the whole label name (even if you're a good typist) because it's easy for minor spelling errors to creep in, which can inadvertently introduce multiple labels with spurious spelling variations.

JBS labels should not be used to write documentation - don't try to write sentences using labels. Adding a number of random labels is unlikely to be helpful to anyone.

> ---
>
> ### Labels are case sensitive
> When using labels in Jira gadgets (like pie charts, heat maps, and statistics tables) Jira will be case sensitive and treat e.g. OpenJDK and openjdk as two different labels. Searching however is case insensitive. This means that if you group a set of issues in a gadget based on a label, and then click one of the groups to see the list of issues, that list will contain more results than the gadget if there are usages of the label with different casing. This can be very confusing and for this reason the recommendation is to stick with the commonly used case for all labels, regardless of your personal taste for upper or lower case letters. Most labels are lower case only, but there are examples where upper case letters are used in the most common version of a label. Use of the autocomplete popup window (described above) when adding labels will avoid inadvertent introduction of labels with differing case.

## JBS Label Dictionary

This table contains some frequently used JBS labels and their meaning. Please help keeping this dictionary up to date by adding your favorite labels. This table doesnâ€™t dictate how to use labels, but rather document how they are used. That said, obviously it will help everyone if we try to follow a common standard and use similar labels in the same way across all entities that use JBS.

    <td class="dictionary">
      An intermittent issue is one that fails sometimes but not always. The exact reason for the intermittent failure is per definition unknown. Once the reason has been identified the issue is no more considered intermittent. An issue isn't intermittent if some characteristics has been found that triggers the failure consistently, even if the actual cause for the failure hasn't been found. For instance if a test fails every time it's executed on a specific host but not on other hosts it wouldn't be considered intermittent as it fails consistently on that specific host. In other cases it may be that we know that a test sometimes is unlucky in some respect and fails due to this. This test could still be considered intermittent even though we know what the reason is if the reason itself appears intermittently.

      Some issues may seem intermittent when looking at test results, even though the reason for failing is actually known. One example is where a test fails consistently on a specific host, or due to specific conditions in the environment. These failures shouldn't be considered intermittent but it may still be valuable to tag these in JBS with one of the labels [intermittent-hardware]{.jbs-label} or [intermittent-environment]{.jbs-label}. This will help to faster identify that the cause of the failure is known without having to read through the entire bug.

      A test that should be platform agnostic but is consistently failing on a specific OS would for instance be labeled with [intermittent-environment]{.jbs-label}, while a test that fails every time it's run on some specific hardware would be labeled with [intermittent-hardware]{.jbs-label}.

Used to tag bugs that for some reason is wasting time or in other ways are causing pain for the OpenJDK maintainers. Examples of issues that could be considered a pain:

* A bug that occurs frequently in testing, maybe on a specific platform, maybe specific to one vendor's test infrastructure, and requires that many maintainers investigate the failure in different test runs just to realize it's the same issue as has been seen and reported before, or worse, don't realize it's a known issue and file a duplicate bug in JBS.

* Bugs that cause tests to fail without a proper explanation causing several maintainers to investigate the failures just to realize there is no information to be found.

* An underlying bug that causes several tests to fail intermittently.

* A bug that causes a test failure in a faraway place and the failure isnâ€™t acted on quickly.

There are other cases as well and there is some flexibility in the definition. If you see a problem that is causing pain for a large number of maintainers, add an explanation in the JBS issue to why you think the issue is a pain and add the label.

If you have a [maintainer-pain]{.jbs-label} bug assigned to you please consider fixing it asap. If you chose not to work on the issue, you should at least be aware that you are choosing to waste others' time and people will be affected by this choice.

As with any issue the best way to deal with a [maintainer-pain]{.jbs-label} issue is to fix it. Another way to reduce the noise is to [exclude the failing test](#excluding-a-test). This is a viable option if there is a limited set of tests that are failing and the bug is actively investigated. When excluding a [maintainer-pain]{.jbs-label} issue, remember to move the [maintainer-pain]{.jbs-label} label to the JBS issue used to exclude. Leaving the label on the closed exclude-issue is helpful for tracking purposes.

[[-self]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-self}
:    Change is a fix to a regression or unit test itself.

[[-perf]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-perf}
:    Change is for a performance bug for which writing a regression test is infeasible; the bug should describe how to verify the fix.

[[-hard]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-hard}
:    It's too hard to write a regression or unit test for this bug (e.g., theoretical race condition, complex setup, reboot required, editing of installed files required, specific graphics card required); the bug should explain why.

[[-long]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-long}
:    Testing requires a very long running time (e.g., more than a few minutes).

[[-big]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-big}
:    Testing requires an unreasonable quantity of resources (e.g., tens of gigabytes of filesystem space).

[[-trivial]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-trivial}
:    Change is so trivial that nothing could possibly go wrong with it.

[[-cleanup]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-cleanup}
:    Change is a cleanup or refactoring of existing code that is covered by existing tests.

[[-l10n]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-l10n}
:    Change only affects localized text.

[[-undo]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-undo}
:    Change is a reversion of a previous faulty change.

[[-other]{.jbs-label}]{#noreg-other}
:    Regression or unit test is unnecessary or infeasible for some other reason; the bug report should explain why.

Examples:  If a bug fix only corrects a change in the build system, then add the [noreg-build]{.jbs-label} label to the corresponding bug. If the change improves loop optimizations in HotSpot, then add [nounit-perf]{.jbs-label} to the corresponding bug.

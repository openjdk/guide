The mailing lists are the key communications mechanism for all OpenJDK work. All participation in an OpenJDK project starts with joining the relevant mailing list. A subscriber to an OpenJDK mailing list is referred to as a [Participant](https://openjdk.org/bylaws#participant) in the [Bylaws](https://openjdk.org/bylaws). As a general recommendation we suggest to subscribe to [announce](https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/announce), [discuss](https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo/discuss), and the `-dev` lists covering your explicit area of interest. All OpenJDK mailing lists are found here:

> [`mail.openjdk.org`](https://mail.openjdk.org/mailman/listinfo)

The OpenJDK Community is a friendly place. To keep it that way it's important to keep a professional tone in emails and be aware that the community is global. Many different people with different backgrounds collaborate in these lists. Even though English is the required language for all lists, many Participants speak other languages as their native language. A high tolerance for non-perfect English is expected from anyone joining these lists. You're also strongly encouraged to use your real name on the mailing lists. This adds to the professional tone of your email. Postings from anonymized mailboxes risk being seen as spam. If you do work in OpenJDK on behalf of your employer, please also list this affiliation. If your GitHub username differs from your real name it's also a good idea to include that to identify yourself and your actions on GitHub.

You must be a member of a list to be able to post to that list. Some lists are moderated to keep the content on topic. Each list has its own archive where you can browse older conversations on the list.

There are a few different types of lists. The list name has two parts to explain what the list is intended for, `<name>-<suffix>`. The name often refers to the project that owns the list or a specific area of interest that the list focuses on. The suffix is explained below. Not all projects or areas have all types of lists described here.

> `-dev`
> :    Technical discussions around the implementation of the project artifacts. This is also where code reviews happen.

> `-use`
> :    Technical discussions around the usage of the project artifacts.

> `-discuss`
> :    General discussions around the project. The special case `discuss@openjdk.org` is used for general discussions around OpenJDK. Discussions around new project proposals usually happens here.

>  `-changes`
> :    Changeset notifications from the source code repositories maintained by the project.

> `-announce`
> :    General project announcements. These lists are tightly moderated and are expected to be low traffic. The special case `announce@openjdk.org` is used for announcements for OpenJDK.

> `-experts`
> :    Expert group discussions. The list is restricted; only members of the expert group can subscribe.

> `-observers`
> :    Open for anyone to subscribe to see what the experts are discussing and potentially to have some dialog with other non-experts. There is no guarantee that an expert is subscribed to the `-observers` list or will see any responses on that list.

> `-comments`
> :    Used by observers to directly provide feedback/comments to the experts (typically a lead will process the comments list and forward things on to the experts list).

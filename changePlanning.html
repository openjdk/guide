<h1>Change Planning and Guidelines</h1>

<div class="version">version 0.02</div>

</div>

<p> This section describes the development process of identifying a bug or
enhancement (formerly "Request for Enhancement" (RFE)) and providing a
solution.  The instructions assume that
the <a href="/bylaws#contributor">Contributor</a> already has a working build
environment and has some familiarity with an existing
OpenJDK <a href="bylaws#_6">Project</a> and its repositories. </p>

<p> Three classes of changes are treated in separate sections:  </p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#bug">Fixing a Bug</a> provides a step-by-step workflow for fixing
    a simple bug. Of particular note is the list of <a href="#noreg">noreg
    bug labels</a> for changes which do not have regression tests. </li>
<li><a href="#api">Adding an API</a> is TBD. </li>
<li><a href="#feature">Adding a Feature/JSR</a> is TBD. </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="bug">Fixing a Bug</a></h2>

<p> This is the list of steps which should be performed when fixing a small
bug.  Small bugs include typos in code or specification, algorithm improvements
for correctness or performance, and code changes required to correctly
implement the specification. </p>

<blockquote><hr/>
<p> Some steps refer to operations which can not be performed directly without
the assistance of a 
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#committer">Project Committer</a>.
For example, any changes to the <a href="bugs.openjdk.java.net">bug
database</a> fall into this category.  Since these steps are required,
<a href="http://openjdk.java.net/bylaws#contributor">Contributors</a>
are urged to work with their <a href="/sponsor/">Sponsors</a> to
complete these tasks. </p>
<hr /></blockquote>

<p> For the purposes of brevity this document will use the term "bug" to refer
to both bugs and enhancements unless otherwise noted.  Hence "fix for a bug"
could also imply "implementation for an enhancement". </p>

<dl>

<dt><strong>1. Discuss the intended change</strong></dt>
<dd>Send an e-mail to the appropriate development mailing list for the Project
  that maintains the code. The e-mail should have a subject line of the form:  

    <blockquote><p><code>
    6543210: My favorite bug
    </code></p></blockquote>

    where <code>6543210</code> is replaced with the actual bug id number or
    "[NEW BUG]" if the bug id is not known and <code>My favorite bug</code> is
    replaced with the bug's summary.  The message should describe the intended
    change, which components may be affected, and any other risks or
    concerns.</dd>

<dt><strong>2. Does a bug id exist for the work?</strong></dt>
<dd><table summary="platformCode">
    <tr><td class="aligned">Y</td>
        <td class="aligned">Continue</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="aligned">N</td>
        <td class="aligned">Create a bug in an appropriate
            component/sub-component.  If the bug should not be publically
            visible, set the "Security Level" to "confidential".</td></tr>
    </table></dd>

<dt><strong>3. Set the bug status to "Open"</strong></dt>
<dd>This communicates intent to fix the bug to other members of the Project.
    It also sets the expectation for downstream teams such as SQE and JCK that
    the bug will be fixed in an upcoming integration.</dd>  

<dt><strong>4. Does the fix for the bug require a specification change,
    directly affect an external interface, or otherwise have a compatibility
    impact?</strong></dt> 
<dd><table summary="ccc">
    <tr><td class="aligned">Y</td>
        <td class="aligned">
            Submission of a CCC request is required.  Work may begin after the
            request has been <a
            href="glossary.html#accepted">accepted</a> by the CCC; the
            changeset implementing the fix may be committed to a team forest
            after the request has been 
            <a href="glossary.html#approved">approved</a> by the
            CCC.  A description of the CCC requirements may be found in
            <a href="reviewBodies.html">Review Bodies</a>.</td></tr>
    <tr><td class="aligned">N</td>
        <td class="aligned">Continue</td></tr>
    </table></dd>

<dt><strong>5. Fix the bug</strong></dt>
<dd>Assuming that the development team approves of the intended approach, begin
    working on the code using the latest source available from the appropriate
    OpenJDK Project <a href="http://hg.openjdk.java.net">repository</a>.</dd>  

<dt><strong>6. Is it possible to write a test to detect the bug?</strong></dt>
<dd><table summary="platformCode">
    <tr><td class="aligned">Y</td>
        <td class="aligned">
            For bugs, provide a <a href="../jtreg/">jtreg</a> regression test
	    as part of the changeset.  For enhancements that directly affect
	    one or more exported interfaces, add an adequate set of jtreg unit
	    tests as part of the changeset.  By convention all regression and
            unit tests should contain an 
            <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS">@bug tag</a>
            referencing at least one bugid.

            <br/><br/>An entirely new test (or tests) may not be required. For
            example, if the bug is an existing regression test failure, then
            when fixing the bug you should just add the new bug ID to the list
            of space-delimited bugs in the
            <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jtreg/tag-spec.html#INFORMATIONAL_TAGS">@bug tag</a>
            of the failing regression test, even if the test did not need to
            be updated.</td></tr>

    <tr><td class="aligned"><a name="noreg">N</a></td>
        <td class="aligned">
            An explanation for why a test is unnecessary or infeasible is
            required.  Such an explanation is recorded by adding a label, and
            possibly a comment, to the bug report.  The label has the prefix
            "noreg" for regression tests and "nounit" for unit tests.  The 
            suffixes and their meanings are as follows: 
    <dl>
    <dt><strong>-sqe</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change can be verified by running an existing SQE test suite; the bug 
        should identify the suite and the specific test case(s).</dd>

    <dt><strong>-jck</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change can be verified by running the JCK; the bug should identify the
        specific test case(s).</dd>

    <dt><strong>-external</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change can be verified by running an existing external test suite; the
        bug should identify the suite and the specific test case(s). <!-- <div
        style="color:blue">XXX Is this still appropriate?  It's not obvious 
        what types of test suites fall into this category.</div> --></dd>

    <dt><strong>-doc</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change only affects documentation.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-demo</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change only affects demo code.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-build</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change only affects build infrastructure (makefiles, copyrights,
        scripts, etc.).</dd>

    <dt><strong>-self</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change is a fix to a regression or unit test itself.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-perf</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change is for a performance bug for which writing a regression test is
        infeasible; the bug should describe how to verify the fix.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-hard</strong></dt>
    <dd>It is too hard to write a regression or unit test for this bug
        (e.g., theoretical race condition, complex setup, reboot required,
        editing of installed files required, specific graphics card required);
        the bug should explain why.</dd>  

    <dt><strong>-long</strong></dt>
    <dd>Testing requires a very long running time (e.g., more than a few
        minutes).</dd> 

    <dt><strong>-big</strong></dt>
    <dd> Testing requires an unreasonable quantity of resources (e.g.,
         tens of gigabytes of filesystem space).</dd>  

    <dt><strong>-trivial</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change is so trivial that nothing could possibly go wrong with it.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-cleanup</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change is a cleanup or refactoring of existing code that is covered by 
        existing tests.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-l10n</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change only affects localized text.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-undo</strong></dt>
    <dd>Change is a reversion of a previous faulty change.</dd>

    <dt><strong>-other</strong></dt>
    <dd>Regression or unit test is unnecessary or infeasible for some other
        reason; the bug report should explain why.</dd>

    </dl>

    <br/>Examples:  If a bug fix only corrects a change in the build system,
    then add the "noreg-build" label to the corresponding bug.  If change
    improves loop optimizations in HotSpot, then add "nounit-perf" to the
    corresponding bug.</td></tr>

        <td class="aligned">
            It is often sufficient to build and test on a single platform,

        <td class="aligned">
            Build and test on all relevant platforms.  Code under

    <tr><td class="aligned">N</td>
        <td class="aligned">Continue</td></tr>
    </table></dd>

<dt><strong>10. Run relevant regression and unit tests on all relevant
    platforms</strong></dt>
<dd>These include tests for external interfaces as well as other kinds of
    tests, e.g., HotSpot tests that use internal verification mechanisms.  See
    <a href="testingChanges.html">Testing Changes</a> for more details. </dd>

<dt><strong>11. Run relevant JCK tests on all relevant platforms</strong></dt>
<dd>Running JCK tests is particularly important if the change may have
    unexpected side-effects.  See <a href="jckAcquisition.html">JCK
    Acquisition</a> for more details. </dd>

<dt><strong>12. Request a review of the changes by sending an e-mail to the
development alias</strong></dt>
<dd>A patch can be submitted as described in <a
    href="../contribute/">Contributing</a>.  Alternatively, a
    <a href="webrevHelp.html">"webrev"</a> may be generated and uploaded to
    the <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/">community code review</a>
    server.  The complete webrev generation and upload procedure is described
    at  <a href="http://cr.openjdk.java.net/">http://cr.openjdk.java.net</a>.
    
    <br/><br/>Changeset pushes before the <a
    href="/projects/jdk8/milestones#Feature_Complete">Feature Complete</a>
    require at least one <a href="/bylaws#reviewer">Reviewer</a>; pushes after
    the Feature Complete require at least two Reviewers.  In either case, the
    more the merrier. Some teams may require more Reviewers.  Check with
    members of the Project. 

    <br/><br/> Reviewers should examine not only the code being added or
    changed but also the relevant unit or regression tests.

    <br/><br/> A change may require multiple Reviewers because it affects
    multiple areas.  Reviewers should be aware that they take full
    responsibility for the appropriateness and correctness of any changes in
    their area of expertise.  If something goes wrong (e.g., the build breaks)
    and the change&apos;s author is unavailable, they may be asked to deal with
    the problem.  Potential Reviewers are encouraged to refuse to review code
    for which they are not qualified. </dd>

<dt><strong>13. Create a changeset</strong></dt> 
<dd>Follow the instructions in <a href="producingChangeset.html">Producing a
    Changeset</a>.</dd>

<dt><strong>14. Update the bug content</strong></dt>
<dd>Bug descriptions and comments should be written in a professional manner.
    </dd> 

<dt><strong>15. Push the changeset into the Project's forest</strong></dt>
<dd>Follow the instructions in <a href="producingChangeset.html">Producing a
    Changeset</a>.  If working with a Sponsor, send the changeset to the
    development mailing list so that they can handle the final push.

    <br/>The push will trigger a update to the bug which will make the
    following changes:
    <ul>
      <li> Set the bug's "Status" to "Resolved" and "Resolution to
        "Fixed". </li>
      <li> Set the bug's "Fix Version/s" to an appropriate release. </li>
      <li> Set the bug's "Resolved in Build" to "team". </li>
      <li> Add a Comment containing a reference to the changeset. </li>
    </ul>
    </dd>

</dl>

<p><em>Congratulations!</em> Your changeset will now make its way towards a
promoted build.  When the changeset becomes part of a promoted build, the
bug's "Resolved in Build" will have a value of "b[1-9][0-9]*" to indicate the
build number. </p>


<h2><a name="api">Adding an API</a></h2>

<p> TBD </p>

<p> This section will cover additional considerations for changes that add new
public APIs.  For instance, they need to be implementable on all platforms. </p>

<h2><a name="feature">Adding a Feature/JSR</a></h2>

<p> TBD </p>

<p> This section will describe the process for adding new functionality which
requires more than just a few new APIs.  In particular, this will cover how the
JSR process interacts with the OpenJDK development life cycle. </p>
